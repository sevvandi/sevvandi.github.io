Thanks for visiting my site. :wave:  I am a Senior Research Scientist at Australia's National Science Agency, CSIRO. I work on statistical machine learning research. I am a multi-disciplinary researcher, an applied mathematician by training. My PhD was in mean curvature flow, which is in the intersection of differential geometry and partial differential equations.
